\section{Clone}
	The Project can be found on \href{https://github.com/BB20101997/AGD-Project}{Github}.
	
	As of writing the Project is still setup as private.
	
	As a first step you should clone the project to your device.
	
	We will assume you have cloned the project to the folder: $\sim$/git/AGD-Project,
	in my case this corresponds to the absolute path: /home/bennet/git/AGD-Project
